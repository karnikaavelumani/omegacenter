## What sparked our imagination?
The inspiration for this website comes from the idea of an alien pretending to be a human and building a technology store dedicated to selling products. However, the catch is that none of these products are actually functional.

## What is the Omegacenter?
The Omegacenter is a mashup of the Omegamart from Las Vegas and the Microcenter. The Omegamart is an exhibition of a supermarket that sells extremely strange products. The Microcenter is a major technology store that provides multiple tech products. 

## Why Threlte?
Svelte has always been an amazing framework to work with when it came to creating fast and simple projects. Threlte gave us the ability to incorporate our own blender art into our websites and give it life! This was a fun experiment in learning more about Threlte and utilizing it to our advantage.

## Will there be more?
Version 1.0 of Omegamart will be submitted for the Threlte Hackathon. However, we will continue updating and improving our website to fit what we pictured in our head. This opportunity gave us the ability to jumpstart this image and actually create it in real life.
